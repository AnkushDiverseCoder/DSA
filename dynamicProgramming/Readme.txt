The FrameWork 

SubSequence Problem

1> Understand the problem in recursion mindset form 1 ( level, choice, check, move )  == Take/ Not Take
2> Decied State and Remaning -> which is depend for recursion solution == State Size of tree with all possible recusrion call 
3> Decide Transisitons == every recusion call how many other Recursion call here it is 2 take or not take 
4> Check Time Complexity == Calculate space using step 2 and time with step 3
